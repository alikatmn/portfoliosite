			<h3>Business Concept</h3>
			<p>Parenting is hard. PlayPlan combines two things can make it easier, <strong>play</strong> and <strong>a plan</strong>. Playplan.com has become an invaluable resource for caregivers, a place they visit daily to find the newest, coolest LOCAL things to do with their kids. Caregivers depend on Playplan.com to provide them with the tools needed to give their kids every opportunity to learn, laugh and grow by gathering all of the local events, storytimes, parks, and activities into one easily accessible site.</p>

			<h3>Logo Design</h3>
			<p>At PlayPlan.com, we find fun. The PlayPlan.com logo was designed to convey that idea with the custom online map marker icon that also gives the feeling of a child's spinning toy top. 

			<h3>Website Design</h3>
			<p>Take a look at most sites that are built for caregivers of young children and you will find a mishmash of bright colors, child-like scripted typefaces, and a startling amount of rainbows and butterflies. While designing Playplan.com, we knew it was important that this website be built for the caregiver, not the child. The site was designed to be a welcoming, organized space that conveys the playful and creative spirit of the children, without becoming a sample of the childrens artwork.</p>

			<h3>Website Development</h3>
			<p>The two most important aspects of Playplan.com is to make it easily updated and customized. It was developed to pull many event descriptions, times and places from multiple websites, and has been built to be easily customizable for local franchisees. </p>
			
			<h3>Application Design and Development</h3>
			<p>Although Playplan.com was designed as a responsive website, future design and development of a stand-alone mobil application is in process. </p>
